# General
- Macs inherently come with python2.7 installed
- The shortcut is `cmd + spacebar` to do a search, launch `Terminal`
- Use `cd` to change directory to folder

# sys.argv:
- `sys.argv` gets the argument list i.e. if you say `python fInput.py eggs.txt`, then `sys.argv[-1]` returns `eggs.txt` as a String
- It can also handle lists as parameters
- This can be useful if they want to replace specific lines of text `python fInput.py eggs.txt STRING_TO_REPLACE STRING_TO_REPLACE_WITH`

# Tips
- You can work with file directories recursively and write to many

# Demo code
- Replace `walk` with `GUCCIGANG`
